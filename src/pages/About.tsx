        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Hi, I’m GH Jo 👋</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed text-left">
            I’m a Full-stack web developer with over 4 years of experience in <b>PHP</b>, <b>Tailwind</b> and <b>SQL</b>,
            and I’m now expanding into modern stacks like <b>React, Tailwind, and Supabase</b>.<br /><br />

            I have lived in <b>Japan for 14 years</b>, gaining a deep understanding of cross-cultural
            communication, and I’ve been living in <b>the United States for the past 4 years</b>,
            further broadening my international perspective.<br /><br />

            My last role was at a <b>global gaming company</b>, where I worked in the overseas
            development department managing multilingual support for European, Chinese, Korean,
            and English versions of our games. Over 8 years, I collaborated closely with team
            members from multiple countries, learning how to coordinate across time zones, languages,
            and cultural differences to deliver high-quality software.<br /><br />

            Currently, I’m leading the <b>full-stack redesign and maintenance of dalsaram.com</b>,
            a legacy PHP website over 14 years old based in DFW, TX. I’m handling the project 
            from the planning stage in <b>Figma</b> to implementation, <b>modernizing the front-end, 
            maintaining and upgrading the database, ensuring responsive design, and maintaining 
            functionality while upgrading legacy code</b>.

            I enjoy building user-friendly applications that solve real problems, exploring new
            technologies, and combining my global experience with technical expertise to create
            solutions that resonate with users around the world.
